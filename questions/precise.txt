Food waste in urban India is a growing concern that reflects deeper issues within consumption patterns, infrastructure, and social inequality. With the rapid rise of urban populations, increasing affluence, and a culture of overconsumption, cities across India are witnessing unprecedented levels of food wastage. In urban households, food is often bought in excess and discarded due to poor storage or over-preparation. Supermarkets reject slightly blemished produce, and restaurants frequently dispose of unsold food. Large-scale events such as weddings and corporate functions also generate substantial waste, often due to a lack of coordination between food quantity and demand.
This waste has serious consequences. Environmentally, rotting food in landfills produces methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide, contributing significantly to climate change. Additionally, food waste means wasted resources, i.e., land, water, fertilizers, and energy used in its production. Socially, it is particularly alarming in a country where millions go to bed hungry. The coexistence of food surplus and food scarcity in urban areas highlights a deep imbalance in food distribution.
To address this issue, a multi-pronged approach is needed. First, there must be better food management at both household and institutional levels. Public awareness campaigns can educate people on mindful consumption, proper storage, and the importance of leftovers. Restaurants and event organizers should be encouraged to partner with food recovery networks and NGOs to redistribute surplus food to those in need. Government policies can support this by offering incentives for food donations and penalizing excessive wastage. Investments in cold-chain logistics and composting infrastructure can also minimize spoilage and divert food waste from landfills. Ultimately, reducing food waste in urban India is not just about saving resources. It is about building a more sustainable and equitable society. Every plate of food saved represents a step toward environmental responsibility and social justice.

India has emerged as a pivotal voice in global climate diplomacy, striking a balance between developmental priorities and environmental responsibilities. As the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, India's policies and positions significantly shape international climate negotiations. However, unlike many industrialized nations, India faces the dual challenge of lifting millions out of poverty while addressing climate change, a reality it has consistently highlighted on global platforms. India has actively participated in major climate agreements, including the Paris Agreement, where it pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030. The country has also committed to achieving 50% of its total energy capacity from non-fossil fuel sources and reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. These targets underscore India's intent to pursue sustainable growth while upholding the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” enshrined in the UN climate framework.
Through initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA), co-founded with France, India has taken a leadership role in promoting renewable energy, especially in developing nations. The ISA aims to mobilize $1 trillion in solar investments by 2030, reflecting India's commitment to clean energy and climate resilience. India also plays a bridging role between developed and developing countries. It advocates for climate justice, emphasizing that historical emissions must be taken into account when assigning responsibilities. This stance has helped bring greater equity to global climate discussions and ensured that the needs of the Global South are not sidelined. Despite challenges, India continues to invest in green infrastructure, electric mobility, and afforestation. It remains a key player in shaping climate policies that are both ambitious and inclusive. As climate impacts intensify, India's role will be crucial in fostering international cooperation, pushing for technology transfer, and ensuring that climate action remains a shared, equitable global goal.

The rise of green banking in India marks a significant shift in the financial sector's approach toward environmental sustainability. As global awareness about climate change and ecological degradation grows, Indian banks are increasingly integrating eco-friendly practices into their operations. Green banking refers to promoting environmentally responsible banking solutions, including green financial products, energy-efficient practices, and digital innovations that reduce carbon footprints. One of the most notable developments in this area is the issuance of green bonds. These financial instruments are designed to fund projects that have positive environmental impacts, such as renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable agriculture. Several Indian banks and financial institutions, including the State Bank of India and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, have issued green bonds to support low-carbon projects and infrastructure. This not only helps fund green initiatives but also attracts climate-conscious investors.
Another major stride has been the adoption of paperless banking. Banks are moving towards digital platforms to minimize the use of paper in everyday transactions. Online banking services, mobile apps, e-statements, and e-KYC procedures are now widely used, offering convenience to customers while reducing environmental harm. These initiatives lower operational costs and demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. Additionally, many banks are now financing businesses that follow green practices and encouraging customers to choose sustainable options through incentives. For example, some banks offer lower interest rates on loans for electric vehicles or energy-efficient homes. While challenges such as regulatory barriers, low public awareness, and limited infrastructure persist, green banking in India is gaining traction. It reflects a growing alignment between financial inclusion, technological innovation, and environmental responsibility. As this trend continues, green banking can play a critical role in driving India's transition toward a greener, more sustainable economy.

In recent years, India has witnessed a sharp rise in “digital arrest” scams, a sophisticated form of cyber fraud where victims are coerced into believing they are under legal investigation. In such scams, fraudsters impersonate law enforcement officials, such as police officers, cybercrime investigators, or government agency representatives. They contact targets via phone calls, video conferencing apps, or even fake official emails, claiming the individual is involved in illegal activities like money laundering, narcotics trafficking, or cybercrimes.
The scammers often present fabricated evidence, including forged documents, fake ID cards, and doctored case files. To intensify fear, they sometimes display the victim's personal details, harvested from data breaches or social media, making the interaction appear authentic. Victims are told they face “digital arrest,” meaning they will be monitored through their devices and cannot leave their location until further orders. The fraudsters then demand “bail” or “verification” payments, which are quickly siphoned into untraceable accounts or converted to cryptocurrency.
A major factor contributing to the rise of such scams is the increasing digitization of official processes in India. While online communication has streamlined government services, it has also created opportunities for criminals to exploit public unfamiliarity with legal procedures. Many victims are unaware that legitimate law enforcement agencies do not request money transfers over calls or video chats.
Law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts are urging citizens to remain vigilant. They recommend verifying any legal claims through official channels, avoiding sharing personal information with unknown callers, and reporting suspicious interactions to cybercrime helplines. Public awareness campaigns are being launched to educate people about the modus operandi of such scams, especially in urban areas where digital interactions are common.
The rise of digital arrest scams is a reminder that while technology can enhance governance and convenience, it also expands the avenues for exploitation. Combating this threat requires a combination of public education, stronger cybersecurity measures, and swift enforcement action against perpetrators. Only through coordinated efforts can India safeguard its citizens from these modern forms of intimidation and fraud.

In recent years, India has emerged as a global leader in solar energy, driven by its commitment to sustainable growth and energy security. With abundant sunlight across most of its territory, the nation has embraced solar power as a central pillar of its renewable energy strategy. The government's ambitious target of installing 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, of which a substantial share will come from solar, has catalysed large-scale investment and technological innovation.
Initiatives such as the National Solar Mission, launched in 2010, have provided policy support, subsidies, and incentives to accelerate deployment. Massive solar parks, like the Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan, the world's largest, demonstrate India's ability to execute projects at scale, producing clean energy for millions of homes. Rooftop solar systems are also gaining popularity, especially in urban areas, reducing dependence on conventional grids and lowering electricity costs for households and businesses.
India's leadership in founding the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in 2015 further illustrates its vision of promoting solar energy globally, particularly in sun-rich developing nations. Through knowledge sharing, financing support, and technology transfer, the ISA seeks to make solar power affordable and accessible worldwide.
Economic benefits accompany this green revolution. The solar sector has created thousands of jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, while reducing the country's reliance on costly fossil fuel imports. Moreover, increased solar adoption helps curb greenhouse gas emissions, aligning India with its climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.
Challenges remain, including land acquisition, intermittency in power generation, and the need for advanced storage solutions. However, with ongoing research, supportive policies, and falling technology costs, these hurdles are gradually being addressed. India's revolution in harnessing solar power is not merely an energy transition, it is a transformation that promises cleaner air, economic growth, and a sustainable future. As the nation continues to innovate and expand its capacity, it stands as a shining example of how a developing country can lead the way in renewable energy adoption.

Passage: Rural India has long been at the heart of the nation’s socio-economic structure, yet it continues to face persistent challenges related to income instability, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to institutional credit. Agriculture, the primary source of livelihood for a majority of rural households, is increasingly vulnerable to climate variability, fragmented landholdings, and fluctuating market prices. These factors often trap small and marginal farmers in cycles of debt and uncertainty.
In recent years, the government and financial institutions have made concerted efforts to strengthen rural credit delivery through schemes aimed at expanding banking penetration and promoting self-help groups and cooperative models. Digital financial services have also emerged as a promising solution, enabling direct benefit transfers and reducing dependence on informal moneylenders. However, issues such as low financial literacy, inadequate digital infrastructure, and trust deficits continue to limit the full utilisation of these initiatives.
For rural development to be truly inclusive, financial support must be accompanied by investments in education, healthcare, irrigation, and market access. Empowering rural communities through skill development and institutional support is essential to ensure that economic growth translates into long-term resilience and improved quality of life.

Passage: Water scarcity is emerging as a serious challenge for Indian agriculture. With over 80% of freshwater consumption dedicated to irrigation, inefficient water use threatens both crop sustainability and long-term water security. Traditional flood irrigation methods not only result in wastage but also cause soil erosion, waterlogging, and nutrient loss.
To address this, micro-irrigation techniques such as drip and sprinkler systems have gained attention for their efficiency and precision. These systems deliver water directly to the root zones, significantly reducing water wastage. Moreover, they promote uniform water distribution, reduce weed growth, and improve fertilizer use efficiency. Despite their benefits, adoption rates remain low, especially among small and marginal farmers due to high initial costs, lack of awareness, and inadequate technical support.
The government has introduced schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) to promote micro-irrigation. Yet, integration with crop planning, farmer training, and ensuring timely subsidies are necessary to boost adoption. A participatory approach involving local institutions, financial agencies, and agri-extension services can bridge existing gaps. Sustainable agriculture in water-stressed regions will depend largely on how well these technologies are adopted and supported.

India's informal economy plays a significant role in the country's economic landscape, employing nearly 90% of the workforce and contributing to a substantial portion of national output. This sector comprises small vendors, construction workers, domestic help, artisans, agricultural labourers, and micro-enterprises that operate without formal registration or access to social security benefits. Despite its contribution to livelihoods and GDP, the informal sector is often neglected in terms of policy attention and institutional support.
The COVID-19 pandemic starkly exposed the vulnerabilities of informal workers, many of whom lost jobs overnight due to lockdowns and lack of safety nets. The crisis highlighted the urgent need to build resilience within this sector through formalization, social protection, and inclusion in digital and financial systems. Schemes like e-Shram and Jan Dhan accounts are steps in this direction, aiming to provide identity, financial access, and targeted welfare delivery to unorganized workers.
However, formalization efforts face structural challenges. Many informal workers lack awareness about schemes or fear losing flexibility. Additionally, formalization without adequate safeguards may lead to exclusion rather than inclusion. Therefore, policymakers must adopt a balanced approach that recognizes the sector's heterogeneity and tailors interventions accordingly. Skill development, portable social security benefits, affordable credit, and technology integration can significantly improve the quality of employment and reduce precarity.
As India aspires to become a $5 trillion economy, the informal sector must be part of the growth narrative. Its inclusion will not only enhance productivity but also ensure equitable development and socio-economic stability. Sustainable transformation of this sector requires coordinated efforts across ministries, local bodies, civil society, and the private sector.

The rapid pace of urbanisation in developing countries has brought both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, cities have become engines of economic growth, innovation, and employment. On the other, they now face mounting pressures on housing, transport, waste management, and natural resources. In many Indian cities, the unplanned expansion of urban areas has led to congested roads, inadequate public transport, informal settlements, and poor air and water quality. These conditions disproportionately affect low-income communities who are often pushed to the city’s peripheries, far from jobs and basic services.
To address these challenges, urban planning must adopt a more sustainable, inclusive, and forward-looking approach. Transit-oriented development, mixed-use zoning, green infrastructure, and affordable housing schemes must be at the centre of planning efforts. Moreover, cities must invest in smart technologies for traffic management, energy-efficient buildings, and digitized public services. These steps can improve the quality of urban life while reducing environmental impacts.
Equally important is public participation. Sustainable cities are not just about infrastructure—they are about people. Local communities must be involved in decision-making, and urban planning must reflect the needs of diverse populations. Strengthening municipal governance and ensuring coordination between agencies is critical to avoid duplication and delays.
Financing remains a key barrier. Urban infrastructure projects require significant investment, which many local bodies lack. Public-private partnerships, municipal bonds, and climate-resilient funding mechanisms can bridge this gap. As India’s urban population is expected to cross 600 million by 2030, the urgency to build resilient, inclusive, and livable cities has never been greater. Future urban development must balance growth with equity and sustainability.

The growing emphasis on women-led self-help groups has emerged as a transformative force in India’s rural economic landscape. Over the past decade, collectives of rural women have moved beyond savings and credit activities to become active participants in local production, entrepreneurship, and service delivery. Through initiatives such as the Lakhpati Didi programme and strengthened SHG–Bank linkage, women are increasingly gaining financial independence and decision-making power within households and communities. This shift has not only enhanced income levels but has also contributed to improved nutrition, education outcomes, and social awareness.
Despite these gains, several constraints continue to limit the full potential of women-led collectives. Many groups remain concentrated in low-value activities with limited market access and weak branding. Inadequate training in financial management, quality control, and digital tools restricts their ability to scale operations. Additionally, social norms, time poverty, and unequal access to land and assets continue to place invisible barriers on women entrepreneurs, particularly in remote regions.
Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive support ecosystem rather than fragmented interventions. Skill upgradation linked to local demand, access to working capital at reasonable rates, and integration with formal value chains are essential. Digital platforms can help SHGs access wider markets, while convergence with schemes related to food processing, handicrafts, and rural services can diversify income sources. Strengthening federations of SHGs can also enhance bargaining power and reduce dependency on intermediaries.
As India seeks inclusive and grassroots-driven growth, empowering women through collective entrepreneurship offers a sustainable pathway. When supported by strong institutions and responsive policies, women-led self-help groups can become engines of rural resilience and long-term economic transformation.

Write a precis of the following passage.

Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) represent a significant challenge to the health and stability of the Indian banking sector. An asset, which includes loans and advances, becomes non-performing when it ceases to generate income for the bank. As per RBI guidelines, a loan is classified as an NPA if the interest or principal amount has been overdue for more than 90 days. The accumulation of high levels of NPAs has a debilitating effect on a bank's profitability and liquidity. It erodes the capital base, restricts the bank's ability to lend further, and consequently, stifles economic growth. The origins of the NPA crisis are complex, stemming from a combination of factors including aggressive lending during economic boom years, lack of due diligence, and project delays. To address this issue, the government and the RBI have implemented several measures. The most notable among these is the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016, which provides a time-bound process for resolving insolvency. While the IBC has shown promise in improving the resolution process and shifting the credit culture from "debtor in possession" to "creditor in control," its effectiveness is still hampered by procedural delays and the limited number of judicial benches.

Write a precis of the following passage.

The gig economy, characterized by short-term contracts and freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs, has emerged as a significant component of the modern workforce. Fueled by digital platforms that connect service providers with customers, it offers unprecedented flexibility and autonomy to workers. Individuals can choose their own hours, work from anywhere, and take on multiple projects simultaneously, which is a departure from the rigid structure of traditional employment. For businesses, the gig model provides access to a diverse talent pool on a project-by-project basis, reducing the costs associated with full-time staff like benefits and office space. However, this model raises critical questions about worker rights and social security. Gig workers are typically classified as independent contractors, which means they are not entitled to minimum wage, paid leave, health insurance, or retirement benefits that are standard for employees. This lack of a safety net creates financial precarity and income volatility for a large segment of this workforce. As the gig economy continues to expand, policymakers face the complex task of creating a new regulatory framework that can balance the benefits of flexibility with the fundamental need for worker protection and security.

Write a precis of the following passage.

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents the next frontier in the evolution of money. A CBDC is a digital form of a country's fiat currency that is a direct liability of the central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized and volatile, a CBDC would be centralized, government-backed, and would hold a stable value equivalent to the country's physical currency. The introduction of a CBDC, such as the e-rupee being piloted by the Reserve Bank of India, could offer several advantages. It has the potential to make payment systems more efficient, resilient, and less costly. It could also promote financial inclusion by providing access to digital payments for those without bank accounts. Furthermore, it could give the central bank greater control over monetary policy transmission. However, the implementation of a CBDC also presents significant risks and policy challenges. Primary among these are concerns related to data privacy, as transactions could potentially be tracked by the government. There is also the substantial threat of cyberattacks, which could disrupt the entire financial system. Finally, the shift to a CBDC could fundamentally alter the structure of the banking system, potentially disintermediating commercial banks.

Write a precis of the following passage.

Climate change is no longer a distant environmental threat; it is a present and escalating economic reality. The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events&mdash;such as floods, droughts, and cyclones&mdash;have a direct and devastating impact on key sectors of the economy. Agriculture, which is highly dependent on predictable weather patterns, is particularly vulnerable. Crop failures due to erratic monsoons or prolonged droughts threaten food security and the livelihoods of millions. Beyond agriculture, critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and power grids face significant damage, requiring massive capital expenditure for repair and reconstruction. The economic costs are not limited to physical damages alone; they also manifest as supply chain disruptions, increased insurance premiums, and negative impacts on public health, which reduces workforce productivity. Mitigating these risks requires a two-pronged approach. Firstly, there is an urgent need for investment in climate adaptation strategies, such as building resilient infrastructure and promoting climate-smart agriculture. Secondly, a decisive shift towards a green economy, powered by renewable energy sources, is essential not only to curb emissions but also to unlock new avenues for sustainable economic growth and job creation.

Write a precis of the following passage.

Financial inclusion, the process of ensuring access to appropriate financial products and services for all sections of society, is a cornerstone of equitable economic development. For decades, a large segment of India's population remained outside the formal financial system, relying on informal credit sources with exorbitant interest rates. The launch of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in 2014 was a watershed moment, leading to the opening of millions of basic savings bank accounts and providing a gateway to the formal economy. This was further bolstered by the "JAM trinity" - Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile - which linked these accounts to a unique identity and a mobile number, enabling direct benefit transfers (DBT) and reducing leakages in social welfare schemes. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has built upon this foundation, revolutionizing digital payments and making them accessible even to the smallest vendors. While these initiatives have been remarkably successful in expanding access, the challenge now shifts from account opening to ensuring active usage. True financial inclusion requires promoting financial literacy, creating tailored credit and insurance products for low-income households, and ensuring the last-mile delivery of services is both reliable and affordable.
